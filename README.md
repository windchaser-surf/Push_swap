## Overview

The Push_swap project is a C programming challenge focused on sorting a set of integers using two stacks and a limited set of operations. The goal is to create an efficient sorting algorithm that outputs the smallest sequence of instructions to sort the integers provided as input.

## Objectives

- **Sorting Algorithm**: Develop a program called `push_swap` that sorts integers using two stacks.
- **Efficiency**: Learn to analyze and implement sorting algorithms with a focus on their complexity.
- **Memory Management**: Ensure proper handling of memory allocation and deallocation to avoid leaks.

## Key Features

- **Two Stacks**: Utilize two stacks to manipulate and sort the integers.
- **Instruction Set**: Implement a specific set of operations to move integers between the stacks and sort them.

## Learning Outcomes

- Gained experience in writing sorting algorithms and understanding their complexities.
- Improved skills in C programming, particularly in memory management and error handling.
- Developed the ability to create efficient algorithms tailored to different input configurations.

## Conclusion

Completing the Push_swap project has enhanced my understanding of sorting algorithms and their implementation in C. It has also provided valuable experience in managing memory and optimizing code for performance. This project serves as a solid foundation for further exploration in algorithm design and data structures.
